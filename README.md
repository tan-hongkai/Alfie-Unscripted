### Overview
The app processes Alfie Solomons' dialogues to visualize his speech patterns, moods, and word usage.This project was created out of a personal fascination with Alfie Solomons' unique dialogue style and character portrayal. It does not hold significant business value but serves as a fun exploration of character analysis through data visualization.

## What I Learned
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) from implementing sentiment analysis and tokenization to better understand dialogue content.

2. Handling processing of text data, such as aggregating text, handling special characters and stopwords.

3. How bigram and possibly trigram networks visualize word pair relationships within dialogues.
